It's not about<br /> planting trees, it's about the overall result for the environment and for the people who<br /> live there. Regaining ecological integrity to enhance human well-being is key to<br /> ensure the forest will be protected for the long term.	</p>

                <p style="padding-left:100px;padding-right:100px;padding-bottom:20px;line-height:1.6; ">Five hundred thousand workers are employed in forestry and related industries such as logging, village carpentry and manufacture of timber components for the construction industry. However, the forestry sector contributes only 0.3 percent to GNP.<br /><br />

Between 1996 and 2000, on average, 31.66 million m3 of roundwood and 2.35 million m3 of industrial roundwood were produced annually from state forests and farmlands. A further 532 000 m3 of industrial roundwood was imported annually to meet national demand.<br /><br />

Forests supply 32 percent of Pakistan’s total energy needs in the form of fuelwood. Ninety percent of rural, and sixty percent of urban households use fuelwood, together with other forms of biomass as their primary energy source.<br /><br />

Forests provide forage for one third of Pakistan’s 86 million head of livestock. Leather, wood and other livestock products contribute US$400 million or 9 percent of total export earnings. Trampling and browsing by increasing numbers of livestock are causing forest destruction and uncontrolled grazing is a major obstacle to sustainable forest management.<br /><br />

Forests are vital in protecting the catchment areas of reservoirs used for power generation and irrigation. Agriculture, which contributes 26 percent to GDP, is highly dependent on irrigation in Pakistan and annual losses due to flooding, soil erosion in upland watersheds and siltation in reservoirs and irrigation works is estimated at Rs.2.3 billion.</p>

                <p style="font-size:28px;line-height:1.8;font-weight:300;padding-left:100px;padding-right:100px;">In order to stay below a temperature rise of 2 degrees,
                    we need to remove the excess carbon from our atmosphere. A simple nature-based solution exists.<br />According to the United Nations, countries must
                    have a forest cover of at least 25 per
                    cent of their total land and cities must have a forest cover of 10 per cent.Pakistan has less than 2.2 per cent total land that is forested. However,
                    another report indicates that country has even less than 1.91 per cent forest cover, which is devastating</p>

               <h3 style="font-size:22px;"> 1. Intervention</h3>
                <p style="font-size:20px;">We identify and intervene in areas where there is growing threat of further degradation.</p>
                        <h3 style="font-size:22px;"> 2. Tropical focus</h3>
                <p style="font-size:20px;">Our geographical focus is the tropics where forests and trees are more efficient at cooling temperatures through evapotranspiration and cloud reflectivity.</p>
                        <h3 style="font-size:22px;">  3. Root cause</h3>
                <p style="font-size:20px;">	We identify the root causes of forest degradation and work towards developing alternatives.&nbsp;</p>
                        <h3 style="font-size:22px;">  4. Community engagement</h3>
                <p style="font-size:20px;">We work with local communities to give them ownership, leverage local knowledge and enhance environmental stewardship capacity.</p>
                        <h3 style="font-size:22px;">  5. Livelihood improvement</h3>
                <p style="font-size:20px;">We look to diversify income streams to make community livelihoods more resilient such as increasing the supply of forest-related products (medicines, foods, other resources), monetary income from alternative sources (direct employment in restoration activities, ecotourism), fostering and facilitating entrepreneurship.</p>

          <p style="line-height:1.6;font-size:20px;padding-right:100px;font-weight:200;">  High density planting of a large number of tree species based on species specific<br /> characteristics - such as growth rate, canopy cover, 
            lifespan and seeding traits<br /> – for the purpose of ecological restoration.&nbsp;These trees have become an important<br /> part
              of the ecosystem and are able to grow faster compared to other species.<br /> Native trees like<span style="color:yellowgreen;"> plaksa tree (pipal), 
              banyan, coconut, or margosa (neem)</span> not only benefit<br /> from
              growing in the Pakistani environment, but also benefit their surroundings in turn.<br /> <%--This technique is used to recover degraded<br /> areas and 
            create corridors between forest fragments. The approach incorporates<br /> a variety of planting schemes that take into account the typical changes we
            observe<br /> in forest communities over time e.g. species composition will change over time.--%></p>
